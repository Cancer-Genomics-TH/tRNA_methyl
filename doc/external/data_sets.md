### mapping 

We used the same procedure for mapping as with Bo-Seq data set. Despite that the read lengths from Chen et al. are longer and that they use different chemistry the coverage of 5-primes of selected tRNAs is also low, both when mapping small RNA untreated or TRAC-seq reads. TRAC-Seq in blue.
